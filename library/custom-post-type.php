/* Bones Custom Post Type Example
This page walks you through creating 
a custom post type and taxonomies. You
can edit this one or copy the following code 
to create another one. 

I put this in a separate file so as to 
keep it organized. I find it easier to edit
and change things if they are concentrated
in their own file.
